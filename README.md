Evernote2Omnifocus
==================

Evernote2Omnifocus helps you to make Evernote notes into Omnifocus tasks with respect to the given reminder time

The original script is made by Thanh Pham from [Asian Efficiency](http://www.asianefficiency.com)
Imagine you are capturing a lot of notes and you want to later review them in Omnifocus? Most of the time you will forget transferring the notes into your Omnifocus inbox. This script will help automate this process.

For every note that you want to review, all you have to do is tag it with "review" (without quotes) and this script will 
automatically make a new task in your Omnifocus inbox for review that links back to your Evernote note. When your Evernote note has a reminder time, it will transfer that to Omnifocus and delete the original reminder time in Evernote

By default the format of the task is:

"Review: title of your Evernote note" (without the quotes)

Once the task is created, the script will delete the tag from the note in Evernote.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Evernote
* Omnifocus

Credit goes to Nick Wild of [360 Degree Media](www.360degreesmedia.com/) and Thanh Pham 
of [Asian Efficiency](www.asianefficiency.com) for the original script. All I have done is modified some bits and pieces, 
but all credit should go to Nick Wild and Thanh Pham.


If you want to have this script run automatically on a regular interval, use the program Lingon. Read this blog post on how to do it:

Have fun with the script.
